### About me

I am a mechanical engineer and scientist with over ten years of experience in scientific programming and computations including image and signal processing. Recently my scientific interests expanded to machine learning and neural networks. As a problem-solving-oriented person with the ability to understand complicated mathematical models and a strong mechanical engineering background, I  am ready to dive into a data-driven world as a data scientist/ML engineer ðŸ˜„
